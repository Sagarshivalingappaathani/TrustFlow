# TrustFlow: AI Agent Powered Supply Chain on Ethereum

## Problem Statement

The Global B2B Supply Chain Ecosystem suffers from fragmented supplier relationships, manual procurement processes, and lack of transparency, resulting in significant operational inefficiencies and financial losses. Organizations struggle with limited market visibility, counterfeit goods, payment disputes, and technical barriers that prevent optimization of pricing, risk assessment, and supplier partnerships. These challenges leave businesses unable to efficiently manage both long-term relationships and dynamic spot market opportunities, hindering overall supply chain performance and trust.
